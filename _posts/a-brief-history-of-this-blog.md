description: How and why this blog was made.

Not sure how many developers would think "It would be pretty cool if I can build my own blog" at some point in their life. But I happen to be one of those developers.

I've had this idea of having a blog that I can write in Markdown then just publish for years since 2015. The first iteration wasn't successful. I wanted to have an online Markdown editor that renders the end result in real time (or at least to see preview like GitHub) then I can publish or edit the Markdown file later through a portal only I have access to. But now it seems to be way too ambitious for my lack of motivation to actually make it happen. Years later, I stumbled upon [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) which finally made this idea come true.

I've also started a hobby of photography since 2019 after COVID-19 happened. I'm sort of a tech nerd as well so I thought "OK, maybe I will also use my blog to talk about photography and the gears I have as well.", but to achieve this goal the blog page must be able to support more complex components (e.g. what if I want to have an image carousel in my post?). It didn't take me too long to find out [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/mdx/) is a thing, and it's exactly what I was looking for.

Very excited to have a little corner of mine on the internet and hopefully I can share some meaningful/helpful contents here.
